JSON Schemas can be used as powerful contracts to validate data within an organisation - whether it be objects in memory, data at rest in databases or object storage, or data moving between between components across a network via API calls or event streams.

JSON Schema Manager (JSM) is a CLI framework that provides firm foundations, and a robust workflow for developing, testing, deploying, and evolving JSON Schemas over time, especially in large enterprise environments.

This repo contains the implementation of the `jsm` CLI tool.
